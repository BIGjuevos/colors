# colors
JavaScript color manipulation library.  It provides several "classes" that allow you to manipulate colors on the fly in the browser.

# installing
Since it's in bower, it is really simple.

    bower install js-colors

# development
I love to have people help me write software.  Feel free to submit a pull request as long as the following is true:

1. Code coverage is still at 100%
2. You have at least one test for each bit of your added functionality
3. You update the documentation accordingly
4. It still passes eslint

To work on the code simply:

1. Install all of the dependencies (luckily npm makes this really easy)

        npm install
2. Edit what you need to in colors.js
3. Make sure tests pass

        karma start
4. Make sure eslint passes

        eslint
5. YAY! Thanks for contributing!
