# installing
Since it's in bower, it is really simple.

    bower install js-colors

If you don't want to use bower (even though it is really awesome), you can download a precompiled release directly from the [js-colors website](http://bigjuevos.github.io/js-colors/) in the [downloads section](http://bigjuevos.github.io/js-colors/downloads/).

# development
I love to have people help me write software.  Please submit a pull request as long as the following is true:

1. Code coverage is still at 100%
2. You have at least one test for each bit of your added functionality
3. You update the documentation accordingly
4. It still passes eslint

If you can't meet (or don't know how) to satisfty the above conditions, don't worry, it's collaborative, we can do it together!
